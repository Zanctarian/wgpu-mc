#### Intro

`wgpu` is a crate implementing the WebGPU specification in Rust. It's primary backends are Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.

#### Goals

wgpu-mc is a standalone, mostly-batteries-included rendering engine written in Rust.
Electrum is a fabric mod that integrates wgpu-mc with Minecraft.

#### Current status

Both the engine and Electrum are both currently under active development.
wgpu-mc is fairly mature, while Electrum is more WIP.
